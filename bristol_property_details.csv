The flat is located just a short walk from Bristol City Centre and the popular North Street running from Bedminster to Southville.

Turning left from the main doors there are all the shops and cafes of Bedminster Parade and East Street, leading in turn to North Street, the popular hub of south Bristol, home to popular restaurants like North Street Standard and The Spotted Cow. Crossing the river, you are just minutes from all Bristol City Centre has to offer. For those who work in the city, the commute by foot or bike is short and painless, whilst the journey home after an evening in a city is also straightforward and advantageous on foot rather than negotiating city centre traffic. Being minutes from the train station and close to roads which can take you out of the city in either direction, the location of Squires Court is certainly key to its popularity.<br><br><strong>Access &amp; Parking</strong><br><ul><li>The flat is situated on the first floor with access via stairs or a lift.</li><li>The flat has one allocated parking space which is situated under cover.</li></ul><strong>What the Landlord Says…</strong><br>I lived at Squires Court for about 7 years, in a different flat to being with and then in this flat after I bought it, and absolutely loved my time here. The flat is spacious (one of the bigger flats in the development) and is conveniently located close to loads of good restaurants, cafes and bars. Bristol Temple Meads train station is a 10 minute walk, it's walking distance from Cabot Circus and Victoria Park is also just down the road, which is a great spot for a BBQ or a game of tennis. The Squires Court community is also really friendly and the flat has private underground parking which is handy.<br><br><strong>Energy Efficiency</strong><br>According to the energy performance certificate, this property is rated as a 'C' for both energy efficiency and environmental impact.<br><br><strong>Summary &amp; Exclusions:</strong><br>- Rent Amount: £1,600.00 per month (£369.23 per week)<br>- Deposit / Bond: £1,600.00<br>- 2 Bedrooms<br>- 2 Bathrooms<br>- Property comes furnished<br>- Available to move in from 02 June, 2024<br>- Minimum tenancy term is 12 months<br>- Maximum number of tenants is 2<br>- No Students<br>- No Pets, sorry<br>- No Smokers<br>- Family Friendly<br>- Bills not included<br>- Property has parking<br>- No Garden Access<br>- EPC Rating: C<br><br><strong> If calling, please quote reference: 2021473 </strong><br><br><strong>Fees:</strong><br>You will <strong>not</strong> be charged any admin fees.<br><br>** Contact today to book a viewing and have the landlord show you round! **<br>Request Details form responded to 24/7, with phone bookings available 9am-9pm, 7 days a week.<br><br><i>OpenRent endeavours to make all property particulars as accurate and reliable as possible, however if you require any further clarification or information please contact us.
